🚀 RAIN VENTURES TEAM 🚀

I'm going to be blunt: I've been using Neo for months, and it's given me an unfair advantage over the rest of you.

Every day I get:
• 24/7 calendar monitoring and conflict prevention
• Auto email triage and draft responses
• Proactive deal pipeline tracking
• Meeting prep done before I think about it
• Instant research and document generation
• Zero follow-ups dropped

Meanwhile, the team is manually juggling Slack, email, calendars, and client chaos.

**We say we're AI-first. But right now, I'm the only one with AI leverage.**

That's insane. And it ends now.

I just built the business case for *OpenClaw* — a team-wide deployment that gives everyone the same capabilities Neo gives me.

The numbers are brutal:
• 8-12 hours saved per person per week
• £200-350k/year in productivity unlocked
• 1-2 extra deals closed from reduced coordination lag
• **Total value: £260-450k/year minimum**

Cost? Negligible. We already have the infrastructure.
Time to deploy? 2-4 weeks.

We're building an AI-first company. Let's actually BE one.

**Check out the full case (it's epic):**

I need you all to read this, react, and let's get this deployed. Every day we wait is a day we're fighting with one hand tied behind our backs.

Who's in? 💪
