- **Value:** £200-350k/year in productivity
- **Extra deals:** 1-2/year from faster coordination
- **Total value:** £260-450k/year minimum
- **Cost:** Negligible (infrastructure we have)

## 💡 Talking Points If They Push Back

**"Is this just Craig's pet project?"**
→ No. The productivity metrics are team-wide. Everyone gets 8-12 hours back per week.

**"How much will this cost?"**
→ Infrastructure we already have. Marginal cost is near zero.

**"Will it actually work for the whole team?"**
→ It's literally the same system Craig uses daily. Proven, not theoretical.

**"How long to deploy?"**
→ 2-4 weeks for full team rollout. Can pilot with 2-3 people in 1 week.

**"What if people don't use it?"**
→ That's a change management issue, not a capability issue. We make it part of the workflow, not optional.
